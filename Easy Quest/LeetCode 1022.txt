LeetCode 1022 (Easy)

Q:- You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value 0 or 1. Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.

For example, if the path is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1, then this could represent 01101 in binary, which is 13.
For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf. Return the sum of these numbers.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bits integer.

Example:- 
Input: root = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 22
Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22

              1
           /    \
          0      1
         / \    / \
        0   1  0   1

Solution: 
class Solution {
    public int sumRootToLeaf(TreeNode root) {
         return Sum(root,0);
    }
    public int Sum(TreeNode root,int sum){
           if(root==null)
            return 0;
        
        sum = (sum<<1)+root.val;
        
        if(root.left==null && root.right==null)
            return sum;
        
        return Sum(root.left,sum)+Sum(root.right,sum);

    }
}

Gist: We have to approach the tree as DFS and then store CurrNum on each Node with help of recursion.

  MainSum     root      currNumber/sum
    0           1          1
    0           0          2 (done)
    4           0          4 (done)
    9           1          5
    9           1          3 (done)
    15          0          6 (done)
    22          1          7 


currNum = 0 << 1 + root.val(1)
currNum = 1 
currNum = 1 << 1 + root.val(0)
currNum = 2
currNum = 2 << 1 + root.val(0)
currNum = 4

MainRes = MainRes + 4
